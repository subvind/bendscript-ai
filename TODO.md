after todo: i will update my code base with the submitted files and run
the program ... if there is an error then it will be placed within ./CURRENT_ERROR.md
otherwise assume i have updated my requirements.

durring todo: if there is an error within ./CURRENT_ERROR.md then help me solve that
otherwise don't worry about it and proceed with todo rules.
